            <p>All organizers, attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at Hacktoberfest community events are required to agree to uphold the following code of conduct. Hacktoberfest community event organizers and/or DigitalOcean staff will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment.</p>

            <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
            <p>Hacktoberfest is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue or online environment, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers or DigitalOcean employees.</p>

            <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.</p>
            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organizing team immediately. If you have concerns about a member of the organizing team, please email hacktoberfestevents@digitalocean.com.</p>
            <p>Any reports of harassment can be reported to <a href="mailto:willemm@infosupport.com">willemm@infosupport.com</a> we'll assist you in any way we can.  </p>
            <p>We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at all Hacktoberfest related event venues, online and offline.</p>
